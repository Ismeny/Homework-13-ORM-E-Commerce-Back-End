## Usage
Give a functional Express.js API,
when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
when I enter schema and seed commands
then a development database is created and is seeded with test data
when I enter the command to invoke the application
then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
when I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
when I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
